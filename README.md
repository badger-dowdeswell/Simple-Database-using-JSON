# Simple Database for Visual Studio C# projects using JSON

Otago Polytechnic Auckland International Campus Studio 2 projects often need a simple database to persist data such as customer and product information.

This project demonstrates how to build a custom class to manage each database table in a way similiar to how an SQL client might manage a database. However, the tables are
stored as separate Java Script Object Notation (JSON) format text files.  

JSON is an open standard file format that uses human-readable text to store information as data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays. You can read more about the JSON standard on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

## Installing the JSON Serializer components into Visual Studio
The application reads and writes JSON-format files using a Visual Studio package called _System.Text.Json -Version 4.7.2_ that is not installed automatically.

- Open your Simple_Database project in Visual Studio.
- Use the menu to access Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console to open the Package Manager Console window.
- Paste this command into the Package Manager Console Window beside the prompt PM>

  NuGet\Install-Package System.Text.Json -Version 4.7.2
          
- The Package Manager should say this after the package has been downloaded and installed:

  Successfully installed 'System.Text.Json -Version 4.7.2' to Simple_Database

When running the Simple_Database application, you may see a security vunerability warning about this package in the Console window. Do not be concerned. The vunerability relates to an issue if the Serializer is used in C# Web applications, not Windows Desktop Forms applications.
